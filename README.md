hello there, welcome to my first ever project.
the idea its that its kind of like a super generic dungeon crawler RPG just like any other. this is purely a project to get my feet a little bit wet and learn
the fundamentals of programming. I will try to keep the code clean, readable and well structured. i'll list what i've already done up to this point, and what i plan to add.
what i've done up to this point:
1- player class and enemy class
2-basic combat
3- an inventory system (this one is like half a point, its basic and can definetely be improved on)
4-dynamic way of creating items
5-basic game loop
what i need to do:
-a more complex/"FUN" combat system.
-persistent inventory
-save files
-more content(enemies, random events, basically, making the game "FUN")
-a better leveling system
(for some reason it does NOT respect enters, and thus this format looks bad. i'll change it at some point, probably, but rn its good enough.)
